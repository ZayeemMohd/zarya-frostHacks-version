## Inspiration

Donations are one of the best ways with which we can spread **hope** in the very world we live in, perhaps by **helping each other**, yet there have been many **scams** recorded in this act spreading positivity and kindness, which promotes giving.
These scams occur due to a **lack of transparency** in the act of donation.

With the involvement of **intermediaries** in offline and online donations, there have been many unavoidable scam cases recorded in the past few years. 

People do not know whom to trust in such situations, thereby giving personal information and money in some cases in the hope that they will get solutions to their problems and needs. 

This goes both ways, for people trying to help others in need & people trying to get help.

Both **Donors** & **Beneficiaries**  are at risk of being duped.

Examples :

[Selling Sympathy in the name of children](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/fraudsters-make-a-killing-on-crowdfunding-platforms/articleshow/84601747.cms)

We wanted to create a **platform that connects donors directly with those in need**, cutting out scams & intermediaries with the sole focus on **transparency**.


## What it does

1. It verifies and showcases genuine beneficiary profiles, fostering immediate and trustworthy connections. 
2. It removes any & all third party interaction between beneficiaries & donors.
If the donor is willing they can directly approach & personally help the beneficiary.
3. Zarya aims to redefine crowdfunding, restoring faith in the act of giving and making a real impact.


## How we built it

There exists a large number of people who are willing to help those who are actually in need of help. But, the issue remain that there is no centralized platform for such individual.

During the floods in Hyderabad in 2020 such small communities of motivated individuals played a pivotal role in providing quick & effective help to those effected.
Unfortunately a few lives were still lost due to the unorganized nature of such groups leading to delays in rescue efforts & a lot of money was misplaced due to ill intent individuals gathering money in the name of helping others & disappearing with it.

This brought forth the need for a platform to moderate & organize the data & efforts of philanthropic individuals and those who genuinely need their help.

A Facebook group called [ZAR'ya](https://www.facebook.com/zaryabyahes) was formed.

## Challenges we ran into

-Gathering, Managing and verifying data of NGO's, Donors & Beneficiaries to an extent that ensures complete transparency.
-A process that is simple yet comprehensive to ensure data & its clarity from different sources which also includes volunteers looking for those in need.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of

**The Non-Profit Network**
A unique section dedicated to small and local non-profits. 
They can register, create profiles, and upload them for donor consideration, increasing their reach without needless complication. 
Building a direct bridge for those who want to help and those who need help.

**The Donor Hub**
A haven for benevolent hearts, providing direct access to verified profiles of individuals in need. 
Our platform ensures that every donation goes directly to those who need it, unhampered by scams or middlemen. 
Giving the donors reassurance that it is used how they wanted.

**The Beneficiary Gateway**
Ability to reach out to specific people with specific needs. 
Donors get to know about the individuals directly instead of going through third parties.


## What we learned

-Humanity is not all lost, there's still a lot of people who want to help others without any strings attached.
-Its just that the current eco system for giving has too many flaws, cons & loopholes to be exploited by those with ill intentions.
-There's a lot more people around us who need help than we think.

In essence what we've learned is :
*Great opportunities to help others seldom come....
                  but small ones surround us* **EVERYDAY**


## What's next for ZARYA

1. Bring organizations that work for the social welfare but aren't NGO's & help them gain traction.
2. Filter beneficiaries based on location such that people can build local communities to help each other.
3. Build an eco system of donors who can support their own local beneficiaries.
